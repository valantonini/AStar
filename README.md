A 2D A* (A Star) algorithm for C#
=====

![Travis (.com) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/valantonini/AStar/master?style=for-the-badge)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/AStarLite.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AStarLite/)

The world is represented by a WorldGrid that is essentially a matrix of the C# short data type.
A value of 0 indicates the cell is closed / blocked. Any other number indicates the cell is open and traversable.
It is recommended to use 1 for open cells as numbers greater and less than 0 may be used to apply penalty or
priority to movement through those nodes in the future.

The WorldGrid can be indexed via either:

1) The provided Position struct where a row represents the vertical axis and column the horizontal axis 
   (Similar to indexing into a matrix P<sub>rc</sub>).
   
2) The C# Point struct that operates like a cartesian co-ordinate system where 
   X represents the horizontal axis and Y represents the vertical axis (P<sub>xy</sub>).

Paths can be found using either Positions (matrix indexing) or Points (cartesian indexing).

[A Go version is also in to works](https://github.com/valantonini/go-astar)
## Example usage
![PathingExample](Docs/PathingExample.png "Pathing Example")

```csharp
   var pathfinderOptions = new PathFinderOptions { 
      PunishChangeDirection = true,
      UseDiagonals = false, 
   };

   var tiles = new short[,] {
      { 1, 0, 1 },
      { 1, 0, 1 },
      { 1, 1, 1 },
   };

    var worldGrid = new WorldGrid(tiles);
    var pathfinder = new PathFinder(worldGrid, pathfinderOptions);
    
    // The following are equivalent:
    
    // matrix indexing
    Position[] path = pathfinder.FindPath(new Position(0, 0), new Position(0, 2));
    
    // point indexing
    Point[] path = pathfinder.FindPath(new Point(0, 0), new Point(2, 0));
```

## Options
 - Allowing / restricting diagonal movement
 - A choice of heuristic (Manhattan, MaxDxDy, Euclidean, Diagonal shortcut)
 - The option to punish direction changes.
 - A search limit to short circuit the search

## FAQ

q. why doesn't this algorithm always find the shortest path?

a. A* optimises speed over accuracy. Because the algorithm relies on a 
heuristic to determine the distances from start and finish, it won't necessarily
produce the shortest path to the target.
## Changes from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0
- Introduced path weighting to favour or penalize cells. This is off by default and
can be opted into using the new options. See [this blog post for more info](https://valantonini.com/posts/20210401/)
```csharp
var level = @"1111115
              1511151
              1155511
              1111111";
var world = Helper.ConvertStringToPathfinderGrid(level);
var opts = new PathFinderOptions { Weighting = Weighting.Positive };
var pathfinder = new PathFinder(world, opts);
```
## Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- Reimplemented the punish change direction to perform more consistently

## Changes from 0.1.x to 1.0.0
- The world is now represented by a WorldGrid that uses shorts internally instead of bytes
- If no path is found, the algorithm now reports an empty array instead of null
- Moved out of the AStar.Core namespace into simply AStar
- Replaced former Point class with the new Position class that uses Row / Column instead of X / Y to avoid confusion with cartesian co-ordinates
- Implemented support for Point class indexing and pathing which represent a traditional cartesian co-ordinate system
- Changed path from List to Array and changed type from PathFinderNode to Position or Point
- Reversed the order of the returned path to start at the start node
- Rationalised and dropped buggy options (heavy diagonals)
